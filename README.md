## Getting started

### General prerequisites

Make sure you have **node**, **NPM** and **Angular** up to date.

**The highcharts-angular version >=3.2.0 requires:**
* **node >=16.00**
* **npm >=8.0.0**
* **angular/cli >=16.0.0**
* **Highcharts >=10.3.3**

highcharts-angular version 3.2.0 requires:
* node 16.00+
* npm >=8.0.0
* angular/cli 16.0.0+


highcharts-angular version 3.0.0 requires:
* node 14.13
* npm >=8.0.0
* angular/cli 9.0.0+

Previous versions were tested and required versions:

* node 6.10.2+
* npm 4.6.1+
* angular/cli 6.0.0+

### Installing

Get package from NPM in your Angular app:

```cli
npm install highcharts-angular --save
```

In your app.module.ts add the HighchartsChartModule:

```ts
...
import { HighchartsChartModule } from 'highcharts-angular';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...
    HighchartsChartModule
```

In a component that will be building your Highcharts charts you will need to [import Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/install-from-npm) first, so in system console, while in your Angular app:

```cli
npm install highcharts --save
```

Next, in the app.component.ts, in top lines where other `import`s are add another one for Highcharts:

```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
```

In the same file (app.component.ts) add to the **template** Highcharts-angular component selector `highcharts-chart`:

```html
<highcharts-chart 
  [Highcharts]="Highcharts"

  [constructorType]="chartConstructor"
  [options]="chartOptions"
  [callbackFunction]="chartCallback"

  [(update)]="updateFlag"
  [oneToOne]="oneToOneFlag"
  [runOutsideAngular]="runOutsideAngular"

  style="width: 100%; height: 400px; display: block;"
></highcharts-chart>
```

Right side names, in double quotes, are just names of variables you are going to set next, so you could name them whatever you like. Style at the bottom of the selector is optional, but browsers do not know how to display `<highcharts-chart>`, so you should set some styles.

In the same file (app.component.ts) all variables should be set in `export class AppComponent {` like:

```ts
export class AppComponent {
  Highcharts: typeof Highcharts = Highcharts; // required
  chartConstructor: string = 'chart'; // optional string, defaults to 'chart'
  chartOptions: Highcharts.Options = { ... }; // required
  chartCallback: Highcharts.ChartCallbackFunction = function (chart) { ... } // optional function, defaults to null
  updateFlag: boolean = false; // optional boolean
  oneToOneFlag: boolean = true; // optional boolean, defaults to false
  runOutsideAngular: boolean = false; // optional boolean, defaults to false
  ...
```

Used options are explained [below](#options-details).


### Hello world demo

To create a simple demo start with [installing](#installing).

Next for `app.component.ts`'s HTML template use:

```html
<highcharts-chart 
  [Highcharts]="Highcharts"
  [options]="chartOptions"

  style="width: 100%; height: 400px; display: block;"
></highcharts-chart>
```

and export variables:

```ts
export class AppComponent {
  Highcharts: typeof Highcharts = Highcharts;
  chartOptions: Highcharts.Options = {
    series: [{
      data: [1, 2, 3],
      type: 'line'
    }]
  };
  ...
```

Build and run your Angular app to see a basic line chart.

### Angular Universal - SSR

The code running in the server-side rendering runs twice. The first run is done in an environment that lacks window (server-side) and causes Highcharts to be loaded, but not initialized. 
Because Highcharts is strictly bound with the browser events we need to prevent it from running on the server-side. 
To achieve that you can check if `typeof Highcharts` is equal to object (this condition won't be `true` on the server-side), and then use it under the `*ngIf` directive.
```TypeScript
export class AppComponent {
  isHighcharts = typeof Highcharts === 'object';
  Highcharts: typeof Highcharts = Highcharts;
  chartOptions: Highcharts.Options = {...};
}
```

```HTML
<highcharts-chart
  *ngIf="isHighcharts"
  [Highcharts]="Highcharts"
  [options]="chartOptions"
></highcharts-chart>
```

## Options details

| Parameter | Type | Required | Defaults | Description |
| --------- | :----: | :--------: | :--------: | ----------- |
| `[Highcharts]` | Object | yes | `-` | This is a Highcharts instance with **required core** and optional **modules**, **plugin**, **maps**, **wrappers**, and set global options using **[`setOptions`](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/how-to-set-options#2)**. More detail for the option in [the next documentation section](#highcharts-instance-details). |
| `[constructorType]` | String | no | `'chart'` | String for [constructor method](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/your-first-chart). Official constructors: <br>- `'chart'` for Highcharts charts <br>- `'stockChart'` for Highcharts Stock <br>- `'mapChart'` for Highcharts Maps <br>- `'ganttChart'` for Highcharts Gantt<br><br> Keep in mind that `'stockChart'`, `'mapChart'`, `'ganttChart'` require loading the appropriate package or module. |
| `[options]` | Object | yes | `-` | Possible chart options could be found in [Highcharts API reference](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts).The minimal working object that could be set for basic testing is `{ series:[{ data:[1, 2] }] }`. |
| `[(update)]` | Boolean | no | `-` | A boolean to trigger an update on a chart as Angular is not detecting nested changes in an object passed to a component. Set corresponding variable (`updateFlag` in the example) to `true` and after update on a chart is done it will be changed asynchronously to `false` by Highcharts-angular component.|
| `[oneToOne]` | Boolean | no | `false` | The `oneToOne` parameter for [updates](https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Highcharts.Chart#update). When true, the `series`, `xAxis` and `yAxis` collections will be updated one to one, and items will be either added or removed to match the new updated options. For example, if the chart has **two** series and we call the `chart.update` (and this is called on each chart's data change or if `updateFlag` is set to true) with a configuration containing **three** series, **one** will be added. If we call the `chart.update` with **one** series, **one** will be removed. Setting an empty series array will remove all series, but leaving out the series property will leave all series untouched. If the series have id's, the new series options will be matched by id, and the remaining ones removed. <br> <br> The option presented in [the demo](#demo-app) in the first chart - try setting new chart options with different amounts of series in [the textarea input](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-angular/blob/36e158e684b5823e1b1bd1cedf75548022eba1a9/src/app/app.component.html#L7) to see this option in action.|
| `[callbackFunction]` | Function | no | `-` | A callback function for the created chart. The first argument for the function will hold the created **chart**. Default `this` in the function points to the **chart**. |
| `[runOutsideAngular]` | Boolean | no | `false` | When this option is set to `true` chart is created and updated outside of Angular's zone and Highcharts events do not trigger Angular change-detection. Details about `runOutsideAngular` are available in [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/api/core/NgZone#runoutsideangular). This option is more useful for bigger, more complex application (see [discussion](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-angular/pull/73)). <br> <br> The option is presented in [this demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/highcharts-angular-runoutsideangular).|

## Chart instance

A chart instance could be obtained using:

* **chart's callback function** - `chart` is provided as first argument (see [demo app](#demo-app) and first `hcCallback` function)
* **chart's events** - context of all [chart's events](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.events) functions is the chart instance
* **component output `chartInstance`** - emitted after chart is created (see [demo app](#demo-app) and `logChartInstance` function)

**Notice:** If you are getting chart instance from **[chart's load event](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.events.load)** or **chart's callback funciton** and will be supporting exporting, then this function runs again when the chart is exported, because a chart for export is being created. To distinguish when the function is called for the chart and when it's called for the for-export chart you could check `chart.renderer.forExport`. If will be set to `true` for the for-export chart and `undefined` for the main chart.



## Highcharts instance details

This is a Highcharts instance optionally with initialized **[modules](#to-load-a-module)**, **[plugins](#to-load-a-plugin)**, **[maps](#to-load-a-map-for-Highcharts-Maps)**, **[wrappers](#to-load-a-wrapper)** and set **[global options](#to-use-setoptions)** using **[`setOptions`](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/how-to-set-options#2)**. **The core is required.**

_Notice:_ The Highcharts instance is shared through components in an Angular app, so loaded modules will affect all charts.

### Core

As core you could load **Highcharts**, **Highcharts Stock**, **Highcharts Maps** or **Highcharts Gantt** (v. 6.2.0+).

* For **Highcharts**:

```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
```

* For **Highcharts Stock**:

```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock';
```
or as Highcharts with **stock** module:
```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import HC_stock from 'highcharts/modules/stock';
HC_stock(Highcharts);
```

* For **Highcharts Maps**:

```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts/highmaps';
```
or as Highcharts with **map** module:
```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import HC_map from 'highcharts/modules/map';
HC_map(Highcharts);
```

* For **Highcharts Gantt**:

```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts/highcharts-gantt';
```
or as Highcharts with **gantt** module:
```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import HC_gantt from 'highcharts/modules/gantt';
HC_gantt(Highcharts);
```

### To load a module

A module is a Highcharts official addon - including Highcharts Stock [Technical Indicators](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/stock/technical-indicator-series), style [themes](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/themes), specialized series types (e.g. [Bullet](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/bullet-chart), [Venn](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/venn-series)). After Highcharts is imported using Highcharts, Highcharts Stock or Highcharts Maps use `import` and initialize each module on the Highcharts variable.

```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import HC_exporting from 'highcharts/modules/exporting';
HC_exporting(Highcharts);
```

Alternatively, this could be done with `require`, but usually (depends on your app configuration) additional declaration `declare var require: any;` is needed at the top of the TypeScript file in which the modules are loaded.

```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
require('highcharts/modules/exporting')(Highcharts);
```

### To load a plugin

A plugin is a third party/community made Highcharts addon (plugins are listed in the [Highcharts plugin registry](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/add-ons/)). First, make sure that a plugin support loading over NPM and load the required files. In example [Custom-Events](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts-custom-events) supports NPM loading, so after installing the package you could initialize it like:

```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import * as HC_customEvents from 'highcharts-custom-events';
HC_customEvents(Highcharts);
```

If a plugin doesn't support loading through NPM you could treat it as a wrapper - see instructions below.

If a lack of TypeScirpt definitions `d.ts` is showing as an error - see [Solving problems](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/highcharts-typescript-declarations) section of Highcharts documentation for Typescript usage.

### To load a map for Highcharts Maps

Official map collection is published and [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@highcharts/map-collection#install-from-npm) are basic instructions for loading a map.
An example can also be found in the [demo app](#demo-app).

### To load a wrapper

A wrapper is a [custom extension](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/extending-highcharts/extending-highcharts) for Highcharts. To load a wrapper the same way as a module you could save it as a Javascript file and edit it by adding below code to beginning and end of a file:

```js
(function (factory) {
  if (typeof module === 'object' && module.exports) {
    module.exports = factory;
  } else {
    factory(Highcharts);
  }
}(function (Highcharts) {

...
/* wrapper code */
...

}));
```

Next, you will be loading a local .js file, so you should add in `tsconfig.json` in your app `allowJs: true`:

```js
...
"compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    ...
```

The wrapper is ready to be imported to your app. Use `require` instead of import to prevent TS5055 errors.

```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
require('./relative-path-to-the-wrapper-file/wrapper-file-name')(Highcharts);
```

Where `relative-path-to-the-wrapper-file` should be relative (for the module importing the wrapper) path to the wrapper file and `wrapper-file-name` should be the name of the wrapper file.

If a lack of TypeScirpt definitions `d.ts` is showing as an error - see [Solving problems](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/highcharts-typescript-declarations) section of Highcharts documentation for Typescript usage.

### To use [`setOptions`](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/how-to-set-options#2)

The best place to use `setOptions` is after your Highcharts instance is ready and before Highcharts variable is set in the main component. Example:

```ts
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock';

...

Highcharts.setOptions({
  title: {
    style: {
      color: 'orange'
    }
  }
});

...

export class AppComponent {
  Highcharts: typeof Highcharts = Highcharts;
``` 



## Demo app

Download (or clone) the contents of the **[highcharts-angular](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-angular)** GitHub repository.  
The demo app is not using external dependencies but the build of the `highcharts-angular` package thus here it is required to run `npm start` to generate this package.

In system console, in main repo folder run:

```cli
npm install
npm start
```

This opens [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) in your default browser with the app.

To open on a different port, for example `12345`, use:

```cli
npm start -- --port 12345
```

### Play with the app

Keep the console running and change some files - after a save the app will rebuild and refresh the localhost preview.

### Files to play with

* **app.component.ts** (in `src\app`)

Contains Angular main component that uses the *chart* component.

* **chart.component.ts** (in `src\app\chart`)

Contains the chart component that creates Highcharts chart.

## Changing the Component

Using Angular CLI v6, the library must be manually rebuilt on each change
in order to reflect in the demo app.

Run the following command on each change to the `highcharts-chart.component.ts` file:

```cli
npm run build
```

If you are running the demo app in another terminal window when you rebuild the
library, the changes should be reflected in your browser (note: you may need to
refresh the browser a second time after the live reload in order to see the change).

See [https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-create-library](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-create-library)
for details on library builds.

For CHANGELOG.md update use `npm run release`.



## Help and FAQ

For technical support please contact [Highcharts technical support](https://www.highcharts.com/support).

For TypeScript problems with Highcharts first see [Highcharts documentation for TypeScript usage](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/highcharts-typescript-declarations).

### FAQ:

#### How to add and use indicators?

Add [indicators](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/technical-indicator-series) as any other module.
[Live demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/highcharts-angular-stock-with-indicators)

#### How to add and use themes?

Add [themes](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/themes) as any other module.
See the [demo app](#demo-app) in this repository for an example.

More info about custom themes in [Highcharts general documentation](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/custom-themes-in-styled-mode).

#### I have a general issue with Highcharts and TypeScript

The correct repository to report such issues is [main Highcharts repository](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues).

#### Synchronized Charts Angular demo

Based on original Highcharts demo for [Synchronized charts](https://www.highcharts.com/demo/synchronized-charts).

Additionally added class based sync between charts - [demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/highcharts-angular-synced-charts).

#### Property `XXX` does not exist on type `YYY`

It is happening when you are trying to use non-existing property or one of our internal properties that are not publicly available for example `axis.dataMin`. To fix that you need to create your own type that will extend the default Highcharts one with the new properties. Then all you need to do is to cast the selected option / to the extended type - [demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/highcharts-angular-property-xxx-doesnt-exist).

#### How to use Highcharts Maps with the proj4?

Install the `proj4` library and its types `@types/proj4`. Then pass it to `chartOptions.chart.proj4` property. See the [demo app](#demo-app) in this repository or [live demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/highcharts-angular-map-with-proj4) example.

#### I want to render angular component in the tooltip/axis formatter

To render angular component within the chart you can use the angular [portals](https://material.angular.io/cdk/portal/overview) - [demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/highcharts-angular-portals)
